Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Client is The Gaming Room. They wanted software designed to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, to various operating systems.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did particularly well in outlining the system's functionality clearly, including user requirements, design constraints, and a high-level explanation of the chosen architecture. Additionally, I focused on the client's needs by recommending a scaleable and secure approach for a multi-platform game.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through a design document like this is helpful because it provides a clear and well-established understanding of the project's requirements. The document also outlines key information including how data will be exchanged between clients and the server. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of the design documents, I would focus on enhancing the  System Architecture View section.  While I mentioned its purpose, I could improve it by providing a high-level overview of the system's components and their interactions. This could include a simple diagram illustrating the data flow between clients, server, and storage.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I analyzed the user's needs through the provided information about "Draw It or Lose It". These included features like team play, round management, game data, and access requirements. Considering user needs when designing is important because it ensures that the software is solving the desired problems and addresses the target audience's complaints. Building software without this perspective can lead to a product that is technically sound but misses the mark in terms of user experience and functionality.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to designing software in this scenario involved first understanding the requirements, then considering the feasibility of the requirements from a technical perspective and a security focus. In future projects I would add an additional focus on maintainability of the software.
